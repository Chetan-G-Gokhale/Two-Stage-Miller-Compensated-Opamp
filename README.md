# Two-Stage-Miller-Compensated-Opamp
Design of Opamp in 90nm with its layout DRC and LVS cleared.                  

This is my first significant project in cadence, completed in my third year of BE. I advise you to watch "Nagendra Krishnapura" lectures from IITM  on "Analog IC Design" to gain a better grasp of the implementation. I learned about the fundamentals and significance of feedback systems in these lectures and designed a two stage opamp with Miller compensation and programmable nulling resistor.

For the design formulas of the transistors I referred to textbook by P. Allen and D. Holberg,"CMOS Analog Circuit Design",The Oxford Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 3rd ed.
