# SOME APPLICATION USING OP AMP

Opamp the name itself indicates it is used to perform operation on signals such as addition,subtraction and more <br>
So let us verify some basic operation with the opamp created  <br>

### VOLTAGE FOLLOWER AND COMPARATOR
These are the most basic operation which could be done using an op amp. Voltage follower is where output follows the input
and comparator produces an output +Vsat or -Vast relative to inputs (Vp-Vn)

Circuit shows a voltage follower on the first stage followed by a comparator stage , As +Vast =1.2V and -Vsat =0 the voltage follower is clipped off accordingly
